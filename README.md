# Fake Mega Man

This is a game I made for a project in my Game Design 1 class.  It needed to vaguely mimic the actual Mega Man games.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for the purpose of playing this game.

### Prerequisites

Because this was not meant to be a published game and will therefore not be published, you will need to install Gamemaker Studio 2 in order to play.  Gamemaker Studio 2 is available at https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker  You can download a free trial for the purpose of running this game.  Also, make sure you download the game files.

### Installing

These are very clear instructions from YoYo Games about how to install their product:  https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005901728-Installing-GameMaker-Studio-2

## Deployment

After you have installed Gamemaker Studio 2, open the Mega Man game folder and click on the .yyp file.  It will open the Mega Man game in Gamemaker Studio 2. You must then click the triangle-shaped play button on the top toolbar.  A screen will appear that will tell you to "Press Any Key" to begin the game.  Do so when ready.

Your left and right arrow keys on your keyboard control the direction in which Mega Man walks.  The space bar makes him jump.  The S, Z, X, and C keys all allow him to shoot different bullets.  Only certain bulletes will kill certain enemies.  You must kill all enemies and collect all of the hearts in order to complete the level and move to the next.
