# Fake Mega Man

This is a game I made for a project in my Game Design I class.  It needed to vaguely mimic the actual Mega Man games.

As my second solo project in the class, it turned out much better than the previous one (on which I made a 70 average).  The requirements for our first game (a re-make of Pong) were pretty vague, so I took the notes the professor left on my Pong submission and made sure to incorporate his suggestions into this project.  I had left out sound and a few other small things which cost me points, so the Mega Man game had everything I could think of.  I actually ended up making an average of 120 on this project, so I would say that it went over pretty well.  There is background music, as well as sound for the bullets.  There is a start screen (which I think many other students neglected to think of), but who wants to run a game and not get to press the "Start" button?

Overall, I am proud of this project.  I worked very hard on it.  I had a few false-starts where I wasn't sure how to code everything, so I looked at quite a few tutorials online; unfortunately, they just weren't doing what I was trying to do.  Then one evening, I sat down and started working on it, and it just started flowing.  Maybe the previous hours of looking at code helped it sink into my brain; I'm not sure.  But I worked on it until 3 in the morning because I just didn't want to stop.  By the time I went to bed, I had a good majority of the game laid out and functioning (or at least close to functioning), and I knew exactly where I was going with it.  I spent the next few days tweaking and perfecting and adding to it.  I ended up finishing a whole day ahead of the deadline and I was extremely excited about that.

I am aware that it is not a perfect game, but I would like to mention that Gamemaker Studio 2 limits your resources on the free version.  I paid considerable attention to that fact and tried my best to work within those limits. I made sure to maximize the way I used the objects and sprites without reducing the number of features in the game.  Regardless of my obvious newbie status, I did create a game that you can play and win.  If you decide to download and run it, I hope you enjoy!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for the purpose of playing this game.

### Prerequisites

Because this was not meant to be a published game and will therefore not be published, you will need to install Gamemaker Studio 2 in order to play.  Gamemaker Studio 2 is available at https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker  You can download a free trial for the purpose of running this game.  Also, make sure you download the game files.

### Installing

These are very clear instructions from YoYo Games about how to install their product:  https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005901728-Installing-GameMaker-Studio-2

## Deployment

After you have installed Gamemaker Studio 2, open the Mega Man game folder and click on the .yyp file.  It will open the Mega Man game in Gamemaker Studio 2. You must then click the triangle-shaped play button on the top toolbar.  A screen will appear that will tell you to "Press Any Key" to begin the game.  Do so when ready.

Your left and right arrow keys on your keyboard control the direction in which Mega Man walks.  The space bar makes him jump.  The S, Z, X, and C keys all allow him to shoot different bullets.  Only certain bulletes will kill certain enemies.  You must kill all enemies and collect all of the hearts in order to complete the level and move to the next.
